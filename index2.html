Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in
strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These
patterns are used with the |exec|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec>
and |test|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test>
methods of |RegExp|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp>,
and with the |match|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match>,
|replace|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace>, |search|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/search>,
and |split|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split>
methods of |String|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String>.
This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions.


    Creating a regular expression

You construct a regular expression in one of two ways:

Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed
between slashes, as follows:

|var re = /ab+c/;|

Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular
expression when the script is loaded. When the regular expression will
remain constant, use this for better performance.

Or calling the constructor function of the |RegExp|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp>
object, as follows:

|var re = new RegExp("ab+c");|

Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the
regular expression. Use the constructor function when you know the
regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know the
pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.


    Writing a regular expression pattern

A regular expression pattern is composed of simple characters, such as
|/abc/|, or a combination of simple and special characters, such as
|/ab*c/| or |/Chapter (\d+)\.\d*/|. The last example includes
parentheses which are used as a memory device. The match made with this
part of the pattern is remembered for later use, as described in Using
parenthesized substring matches <#Using_parenthesized_substring_matches>.


      Using simple patterns

Simple patterns are constructed of characters for which you want to find
a direct match. For example, the pattern |/abc/| matches character
combinations in strings only when exactly the characters 'abc' occur
together and in that order. Such a match would succeed in the strings
"Hi, do you know your abc's?" and "The latest airplane designs evolved
from slabcraft." In both cases the match is with the substring 'abc'.
There is no match in the string 'Grab crab' because while it contains
the substring 'ab c', it does not contain the exact substring 'abc'.


      Using special characters

When the search for a match requires something more than a direct match,
such as finding one or more b's, or finding white space, the pattern
includes special characters. For example, the pattern |/ab*c/| matches
any character combination in which a single 'a' is followed by zero or
more 'b's (|*| means 0 or more occurrences of the preceding item) and
then immediately followed by 'c'. In the string "cbbabbbbcdebc," the
pattern matches the substring 'abbbbc'.

The following table provides a complete list and description of the
special characters that can be used in regular expressions.

Special characters in regular expressions. Character 	Meaning
|\| <#special-backslash> 	

Matches according to the following rules:

A backslash that precedes a non-special character indicates that the
next character is special and is not to be interpreted literally. For
example, a '|b|' without a preceding '\' generally matches lowercase
'b's wherever they occur. But a '|\b|' by itself doesn't match any
character; it forms the special word boundary character
<#special-word-boundary>.

A backslash that precedes a special character indicates that the next
character is not special and should be interpreted literally. For
example, the pattern |/a*/| relies on the special character '|*|' to
match 0 or more a's. By contrast, the pattern |/a\*/| removes the
specialness of the '|*|' to enable matches with strings like 'a*'.

Do not forget to escape \ itself while using the RegExp("pattern")
notation because \ is also an escape character in strings.

|^| <#special-caret> 	Matches beginning of input. If the multiline flag
is set to true, also matches immediately after a line break character.

For example, |/^A/| does not match the 'A' in "an A", but does match the
'A' in "An E".

The '|^|' has a different meaning when it appears as the first character
in a character set pattern. See complemented character sets
<#special-negated-character-set> for details and an example.
|$| <#special-dollar> 	

Matches end of input. If the multiline flag is set to true, also matches
immediately before a line break character.

For example, |/t$/| does not match the 't' in "eater", but does match it
in "eat".

|*| <#special-asterisk> 	

Matches the preceding expression 0 or more times. Equivalent to {0,}.

For example, |/bo*/| matches 'boooo' in "A ghost booooed" and 'b' in "A
bird warbled", but nothing in "A goat grunted".

|+| <#special-plus> 	

Matches the preceding expression 1 or more times. Equivalent to |{1,}|.

For example, |/a+/| matches the 'a' in "candy" and all the a's in
"caaaaaaandy", but nothing in "cndy".

|?| <#special-questionmark> 	Matches the preceding expression 0 or 1
time. Equivalent to |{0,1}|.

For example, |/e?le?/| matches the 'el' in "angel" and the 'le' in
"angle" and also the 'l' in "oslo".

If used immediately after any of the quantifiers *, +, ?, or {}, makes
the quantifier non-greedy (matching the fewest possible characters), as
opposed to the default, which is greedy (matching as many characters as
possible). For example, applying |/\d+/| to "123abc" matches "123". But
applying |/\d+?/| to that same string matches only the "1".

Also used in lookahead assertions, as described in the |x(?=y)| and
|x(?!y)| entries of this table.
 
|.| <#special-dot> 	

(The decimal point) matches any single character except the newline
character.

For example, |/.n/| matches 'an' and 'on' in "nay, an apple is on the
tree", but not 'nay'.

|(x)| <#special-capturing-parentheses> 	

Matches 'x' and remembers the match, as the following example shows. The
parentheses are called /capturing parentheses/.

The '|(foo)|' and '|(bar)|' in the pattern |/(foo) (bar) \1 \2/| match
and remember the first two words in the string "foo bar foo bar". The
|\1 |and |\2| in the pattern match the string's last two words. Note
that |\1, \2, \n| are used in the matching part of the regex. In the
replacement part of a regex the syntax |$1, $2, $n| must be used, e.g.:
|'bar foo'.replace( /(...) (...)/, '$2 $1' )|.

|(?:x)| <#special-non-capturing-parentheses> 	Matches 'x' but does not
remember the match. The parentheses are called /non-capturing
parentheses/, and let you define subexpressions for regular expression
operators to work with. Consider the sample expression |/(?:foo){1,2}/|.
If the expression was |/foo{1,2}/|, the |{1,2}| characters would apply
only to the last 'o' in 'foo'. With the non-capturing parentheses, the
|{1,2}| applies to the entire word 'foo'.
|x(?=y)| <#special-lookahead> 	

Matches 'x' only if 'x' is followed by 'y'. This is called a lookahead.

For example, |/Jack(?=Sprat)/| matches 'Jack' only if it is followed by
'Sprat'. |/Jack(?=Sprat|Frost)/| matches 'Jack' only if it is followed
by 'Sprat' or 'Frost'. However, neither 'Sprat' nor 'Frost' is part of
the match results.

|x(?!y)| <#special-negated-look-ahead> 	

Matches 'x' only if 'x' is not followed by 'y'. This is called a negated
lookahead.

For example, |/\d+(?!\.)/| matches a number only if it is not followed
by a decimal point. The regular expression |/\d+(?!\.)/.exec("3.141")|
matches '141' but not '3.141'.

|x|y| <#special-or> 	

Matches either 'x' or 'y'.

For example, |/green|red/| matches 'green' in "green apple" and 'red' in
"red apple."

|{n}| <#special-quantifier> 	Matches exactly n occurrences of the
preceding expression. N must be a positive integer.

For example, |/a{2}/| doesn't match the 'a' in "candy," but it does
match all of the a's in "caandy," and the first two a's in "caaandy."
|{n,m}| <#special-quantifier-range> 	

Where |n| and |m| are positive integers and |n <= m|. Matches at least
|n| and at most |m| occurrences of the preceding expression. When |m| is
omitted, it's treated as ∞.

For example, |/a{1,3}/| matches nothing in "cndy", the 'a' in "candy,"
the first two a's in "caandy," and the first three a's in "caaaaaaandy".
Notice that when matching "caaaaaaandy", the match is "aaa", even though
the original string had more a's in it.

|[xyz]| <#special-character-set> 	Character set. This pattern type
matches any one of the characters in the brackets, including escape
sequences
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Values,_variables,_and_literals#Unicode_escape_sequences>.
Special characters like the dot(|.|) and asterisk (|*|) are not special
inside a character set, so they don't need to be escaped. You can
specify a range of characters by using a hyphen, as the following
examples illustrate.

The pattern|[a-d]|, which performs the same match as |[abcd]|, matches
the 'b' in "brisket" and the 'c' in "city". The patterns |/[a-z.]+/ |and
|/[\w.]+/| match the entire string "test.i.ng".
|[^xyz]| <#special-negated-character-set> 	

A negated or complemented character set. That is, it matches anything
that is not enclosed in the brackets. You can specify a range of
characters by using a hyphen. Everything that works in the normal
character set also works here.

For example, |[^abc]| is the same as |[^a-c]|. They initially match 'r'
in "brisket" and 'h' in "chop."

|[\b]| <#special-backspace> 	Matches a backspace (U+0008). You need to
use square brackets if you want to match a literal backspace character.
(Not to be confused with |\b|.)
|\b| <#special-word-boundary> 	

Matches a word boundary. A word boundary matches the position where a
word character is not followed or preceeded by another word-character.
Note that a matched word boundary is not included in the match. In other
words, the length of a matched word boundary is zero. (Not to be
confused with |[\b]|.)

Examples:
|/\bm/| matches the 'm' in "moon" ;
|/oo\b/| does not match the 'oo' in "moon", because 'oo' is followed by
'n' which is a word character;
|/oon\b/| matches the 'oon' in "moon", because 'oon' is the end of the
string, thus not followed by a word character;
|/\w\b\w/| will never match anything, because a word character can never
be followed by both a non-word and a word character.

*Note:* JavaScript's regular expression engine defines a specific set of
characters
<http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.10.2.6> to be
"word" characters. Any character not in that set is considered a word
break. This set of characters is fairly limited: it consists solely of
the Roman alphabet in both upper- and lower-case, decimal digits, and
the underscore character. Accented characters, such as "é" or "ü" are,
unfortunately, treated as word breaks.

|\B| <#special-non-word-boundary> 	

Matches a non-word boundary. This matches a position where the previous
and next character are of the same type: Either both must be words, or
both must be non-words. The beginning and end of a string are considered
non-words.

For example, |/\B../| matches 'oo' in "noonday", and |/y\B./| matches
'ye' in "possibly yesterday."

|\c/X/| <#special-control> 	

Where /X/ is a character ranging from A to Z. Matches a control
character in a string.

For example, |/\cM/| matches control-M (U+000D) in a string.

|\d| <#special-digit> 	

Matches a digit character. Equivalent to |[0-9]|.

For example, |/\d/| or |/[0-9]/| matches '2' in "B2 is the suite number."

|\D| <#special-non-digit> 	

Matches any non-digit character. Equivalent to |[^0-9]|.

For example, |/\D/| or |/[^0-9]/| matches 'B' in "B2 is the suite number."

|\f| <#special-form-feed> 	Matches a form feed (U+000C).
|\n| <#special-line-feed> 	Matches a line feed (U+000A).
|\r| <#special-carriage-return> 	Matches a carriage return (U+000D).
|\s| <#special-white-space> 	

Matches a single white space character, including space, tab, form feed,
line feed. Equivalent to |[
\f\n\r\t\v\u00a0\u1680\u180e\u2000-\u200a\u2028\u2029\u202f\u205f\u3000\ufeff]|.

For example, |/\s\w*/| matches ' bar' in "foo bar."

|\S| <#special-non-white-space> 	

Matches a single character other than white space. Equivalent to |[^
\f\n\r\t\v\u00a0\u1680\u180e\u2000-\u200a\u2028\u2029\u202f\u205f\u3000\ufeff]|.

For example, |/\S\w*/| matches 'foo' in "foo bar."

|\t| <#special-tab> 	Matches a tab (U+0009).
|\v| <#special-vertical-tab> 	Matches a vertical tab (U+000B).
|\w| <#special-word> 	

Matches any alphanumeric character including the underscore. Equivalent
to |[A-Za-z0-9_]|.

For example, |/\w/| matches 'a' in "apple," '5' in "$5.28," and '3' in "3D."

|\W| <#special-non-word> 	

Matches any non-word character. Equivalent to |[^A-Za-z0-9_]|.

For example, |/\W/| or |/[^A-Za-z0-9_]/| matches '%' in "50%."

|\/n/| <#special-backreference> 	

Where /n/ is a positive integer, a back reference to the last substring
matching the /n/ parenthetical in the regular expression (counting left
parentheses).

For example, |/apple(,)\sorange\1/| matches 'apple, orange,' in "apple,
orange, cherry, peach."

|\0| <#special-null> 	Matches a NULL (U+0000) character. Do not follow
this with another digit, because |\0<digits>| is an octal escape
sequence
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Values,_variables,_and_literals#Unicode_escape_sequences>.

|\xhh| <#special-hex-escape> 	Matches the character with the code hh
(two hexadecimal digits)
|\uhhhh| <#special-unicode-escape> 	Matches the character with the code
hhhh (four hexadecimal digits).
|\u{hhhh}| <#special-unicode-escape-es6> 	(only when u flag is set)
Matches the character with the Unicode value hhhh (hexadecimal digits).

Escaping user input to be treated as a literal string within a regular
expression can be accomplished by simple replacement:

|function escapeRegExp(string){
  return string.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, "\\$&");
}|


      Using parentheses

Parentheses around any part of the regular expression pattern cause that
part of the matched substring to be remembered. Once remembered, the
substring can be recalled for other use, as described in Using
Parenthesized Substring Matches <#Using_parenthesized_substring_matches>.

For example, the pattern |/Chapter (\d+)\.\d*/| illustrates additional
escaped and special characters and indicates that part of the pattern
should be remembered. It matches precisely the characters 'Chapter '
followed by one or more numeric characters (|\d| means any numeric
character and |+| means 1 or more times), followed by a decimal point
(which in itself is a special character; preceding the decimal point
with \ means the pattern must look for the literal character '.'),
followed by any numeric character 0 or more times (|\d| means numeric
character, |*| means 0 or more times). In addition, parentheses are used
to remember the first matched numeric characters.

This pattern is found in "Open Chapter 4.3, paragraph 6" and '4' is
remembered. The pattern is not found in "Chapter 3 and 4", because that
string does not have a period after the '3'.

To match a substring without causing the matched part to be remembered,
within the parentheses preface the pattern with |?:|. For example,
|(?:\d+)| matches one or more numeric characters but does not remember
the matched characters.


    Working with regular expressions

Regular expressions are used with the |RegExp| methods |test| and |exec|
and with the |String| methods |match|, |replace|, |search|, and |split|.
These methods are explained in detail in the JavaScript reference
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference>.

Methods that use regular expressions Method 	Description
|exec|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec>
	A |RegExp| method that executes a search for a match in a string. It
returns an array of information.
|test|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test>
	A |RegExp| method that tests for a match in a string. It returns true
or false.
|match|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match>
	A |String| method that executes a search for a match in a string. It
returns an array of information or null on a mismatch.
|search|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/search>
	A |String| method that tests for a match in a string. It returns the
index of the match, or -1 if the search fails.
|replace|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace>
	A |String| method that executes a search for a match in a string, and
replaces the matched substring with a replacement substring.
|split|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split>
	A |String| method that uses a regular expression or a fixed string to
break a string into an array of substrings.

When you want to know whether a pattern is found in a string, use the
|test| or |search| method; for more information (but slower execution)
use the |exec| or |match| methods. If you use |exec| or |match| and if
the match succeeds, these methods return an array and update properties
of the associated regular expression object and also of the predefined
regular expression object, |RegExp|. If the match fails, the |exec|
method returns |null| (which coerces to |false|).

In the following example, the script uses the |exec| method to find a
match in a string.

|var myRe = /d(b+)d/g;
var myArray = myRe.exec("cdbbdbsbz");|

If you do not need to access the properties of the regular expression,
an alternative way of creating |myArray| is with this script:

|var myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec("cdbbdbsbz");|

If you want to construct the regular expression from a string, yet
another alternative is this script:

|var myRe = new RegExp("d(b+)d", "g");
var myArray = myRe.exec("cdbbdbsbz");|

With these scripts, the match succeeds and returns the array and updates
the properties shown in the following table.

Results of regular expression execution. Object 	Property or index
Description 	In this example
|myArray| 	  	The matched string and all remembered substrings.
|["dbbd", "bb"]|
|index| 	The 0-based index of the match in the input string. 	|1|
|input| 	The original string. 	|"cdbbdbsbz"|
|[0]| 	The last matched characters. 	|"dbbd"|
|myRe| 	|lastIndex| 	The index at which to start the next match. (This
property is set only if the regular expression uses the g option,
described in Advanced Searching With Flags
<#Advanced_searching_with_flags>.) 	|5|
|source| 	The text of the pattern. Updated at the time that the regular
expression is created, not executed. 	|"d(b+)d"|

As shown in the second form of this example, you can use a regular
expression created with an object initializer without assigning it to a
variable. If you do, however, every occurrence is a new regular
expression. For this reason, if you use this form without assigning it
to a variable, you cannot subsequently access the properties of that
regular expression. For example, assume you have this script:

|var myRe = /d(b+)d/g;
var myArray = myRe.exec("cdbbdbsbz");
console.log("The value of lastIndex is " + myRe.lastIndex);

// "The value of lastIndex is 5"|

However, if you have this script:

|var myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec("cdbbdbsbz");
console.log("The value of lastIndex is " + /d(b+)d/g.lastIndex);

// "The value of lastIndex is 0"|

The occurrences of |/d(b+)d/g| in the two statements are different
regular expression objects and hence have different values for their
|lastIndex| property. If you need to access the properties of a regular
expression created with an object initializer, you should first assign
it to a variable.


      Using parenthesized substring matches

Including parentheses in a regular expression pattern causes the
corresponding submatch to be remembered. For example, |/a(b)c/| matches
the characters 'abc' and remembers 'b'. To recall these parenthesized
substring matches, use the |Array| elements |[1]|, ..., |[n]|.

The number of possible parenthesized substrings is unlimited. The
returned array holds all that were found. The following examples
illustrate how to use parenthesized substring matches.

The following script uses the |replace()|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace>
method to switch the words in the string. For the replacement text, the
script uses the |$1| and |$2| in the replacement to denote the first and
second parenthesized substring matches.

|var re = /(\w+)\s(\w+)/;
var str = "John Smith";
var newstr = str.replace(re, "$2, $1");
console.log(newstr);|

This prints "Smith, John".


      Advanced searching with flags

Regular expressions have four optional flags that allow for global and
case insensitive searching. These flags can be used separately or
together in any order, and are included as part of the regular expression.

Regular expression flags Flag 	Description
|g| 	Global search.
i 	Case-insensitive search.
m 	Multi-line search.
y 	Perform a "sticky" search that matches starting at the current
position in the target string. See |sticky|
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/sticky>


To include a flag with the regular expression, use this syntax:

|var re = /pattern/flags;|

or

|var re = new RegExp("pattern", "flags");|

Note that the flags are an integral part of a regular expression. They
cannot be added or removed later.

For example, |re = /\w+\s/g| creates a regular expression that looks for
one or more characters followed by a space, and it looks for this
combination throughout the string.

|var re = /\w+\s/g;
var str = "fee fi fo fum";
var myArray = str.match(re);
console.log(myArray);|

This displays ["fee ", "fi ", "fo "]. In this example, you could replace
the line:

|var re = /\w+\s/g;|

with:

|var re = new RegExp("\\w+\\s", "g");|

and get the same result.

The |m| flag is used to specify that a multiline input string should be
treated as multiple lines. If the |m| flag is used, |^| and |$| match at
the start or end of any line within the input string instead of the
start or end of the entire string.


    Examples

The following examples show some uses of regular expressions.


      Changing the order in an input string

The following example illustrates the formation of regular expressions
and the use of |string.split()| and |string.replace()|. It cleans a
roughly formatted input string containing names (first name first)
separated by blanks, tabs and exactly one semicolon. Finally, it
reverses the name order (last name first) and sorts the list.

|// The name string contains multiple spaces and tabs,
// and may have multiple spaces between first and last names.
var names = "Harry Trump ;Fred Barney; Helen Rigby ; Bill Abel ; Chris Hand ";

var output = ["---------- Original String\n", names + "\n"];

// Prepare two regular expression patterns and array storage.
// Split the string into array elements.

// pattern: possible white space then semicolon then possible white space
var pattern = /\s*;\s*/;

// Break the string into pieces separated by the pattern above and
// store the pieces in an array called nameList
var nameList = names.split(pattern);

// new pattern: one or more characters then spaces then characters.
// Use parentheses to "memorize" portions of the pattern.
// The memorized portions are referred to later.
pattern = /(\w+)\s+(\w+)/;

// New array for holding names being processed.
var bySurnameList = [];

// Display the name array and populate the new array
// with comma-separated names, last first.
//
// The replace method removes anything matching the pattern
// and replaces it with the memorized string—second memorized portion
// followed by comma space followed by first memorized portion.
//
// The variables $1 and $2 refer to the portions
// memorized while matching the pattern.

output.push("---------- After Split by Regular Expression");

var i, len;
for (i = 0, len = nameList.length; i < len; i++){
  output.push(nameList[i]);
  bySurnameList[i] = nameList[i].replace(pattern, "$2, $1");
}

// Display the new array.
output.push("---------- Names Reversed");
for (i = 0, len = bySurnameList.length; i < len; i++){
  output.push(bySurnameList[i]);
}

// Sort by last name, then display the sorted array.
bySurnameList.sort();
output.push("---------- Sorted");
for (i = 0, len = bySurnameList.length; i < len; i++){
  output.push(bySurnameList[i]);
}

output.push("---------- End");

console.log(output.join("\n"));|


      Using special characters to verify input

In the following example, the user is expected to enter a phone number.
When the user presses the "Check" button, the script checks the validity
of the number. If the number is valid (matches the character sequence
specified by the regular expression), the script shows a message
thanking the user and confirming the number. If the number is invalid,
the script informs the user that the phone number is not valid.

Within non-capturing parentheses |(?:| , the regular expression looks
for three numeric characters |\d{3}| OR ||| a left parenthesis |\(|
followed by three digits|\d{3}|, followed by a close parenthesis |\)|,
(end non-capturing parenthesis |)|), followed by one dash, forward
slash, or decimal point and when found, remember the character
|([-\/\.])|, followed by three digits |\d{3}|, followed by the
remembered match of a dash, forward slash, or decimal point |\1|,
followed by four digits |\d{4}|.

The |Change| event activated when the user presses Enter sets the value
of |RegExp.input|.

        var OK = re.exec(phoneInput.value);  
        if (!OK)  
          window.alert(phoneInput.value + " isn't a phone number with area code!");  
        else
